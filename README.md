Welcome!
This website is made using ```Ruby on Rails```, ```Backbone```, and an assortment of other cool gadgets. Come on in and enjoy your stay.

Here are some cool features you will enjoy:

* Full user authentication using sessions and password digest
* Upload pictures

I had a lot of fun making this, and I hope you will have a lot of fun browsing through.

One of the coolest features is the rating system. It's based on the number of views and likes over time, and each day the rating is decreased by 10 points until the picture reaches below 50 points. This way, new images have a chance at becoming popular.
